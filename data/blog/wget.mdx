## Introduction:
Wget (short for "Web Get") is a powerful and versatile command-line utility used for downloading files from the internet. It is available on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the many features of Wget and provide a range of command examples to help you become a Wget expert.

## Installation:
If Wget is not already installed on your system, you can typically install it using your system's package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can use apt:
```
sudo apt-get install wget
```
On Red Hat-based systems like CentOS, you can use yum:
```
sudo yum install wget
```

## Basic Usage:
The most basic usage of Wget is to download a file from the web. To do this, simply provide the URL of the file you want to download:
```
wget https://desiguru.dev/
```
For example, to download a sample text file, you can use:
wget https://desiguru.dev/sample.txt

## Saving Downloads:
By default, Wget saves downloaded files to the current directory with the same filename as the source. You can specify a different filename using the -O flag:
```
wget -O output-file.txt [URL]
```

## Recursive Download:
Wget can recursively download an entire website. This is useful for creating local copies of websites. Use the -r flag to enable recursive downloading:
```
wget -r [URL]
```

## Limiting Download Depth:
You can limit the depth of recursive downloads with the -l flag. For example, to download only two levels deep, use:
```
wget -r -l 2 [URL]
```

## Downloading in the Background:
To run Wget in the background and continue using your terminal, you can use the -b flag:
```
wget -b [URL]
```

## Resuming an Interrupted Download:
Wget supports resuming interrupted downloads using the -c flag. If a download is interrupted, you can continue it like this:
