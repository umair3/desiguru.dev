The UPDATE statement in PostgreSQL allows you to modify existing records in a database table. It's a powerful tool for managing data, and we'll dive into the essential components of this query while providing a variety of examples.

The Basic Query:
```SQL
UPDATE public.auth_user
SET is_active = false
WHERE email IN (
  -- List of email addresses (excluded in this explanation)
  'user1@test.com',
  'user2@test.com',
);

```
Explanation:
UPDATE public.auth_user: This part of the query specifies the target table that you want to update. Here, the target table is auth_user, and it's located in the public schema.

SET is_active = false: The SET clause defines the columns that you want to modify and the new values you want to assign to them. In this query, we are setting the is_active column to false. This means we're deactivating certain users in the auth_user table.

WHERE email IN (...): The WHERE clause allows you to specify the condition that records must meet to be updated. In this example, the condition is based on the email column. Rows are updated only if the email value is found in the list you provided.

## Example 1: Deactivating All Users
Suppose you want to deactivate all users in the auth_user table. You can use the following query:
```SQL
UPDATE public.auth_user
SET is_active = false;
```
This query will set the is_active column to false for all users in the table.

## Example 2: Updating Specific User Information
You can also use the UPDATE query to modify other user details. For instance, if you want to change the username of a user with the email "abc@desiguru.dev", you can use the following query:
```SQL
UPDATE public.auth_user
SET username = 'abc_desi_guru'
WHERE email = 'abc@desiguru.dev';
```
This query will update the username of the user with the specified email.


## Example 3: Conditional Update
In some cases, you may want to update records that meet specific conditions. Let's say you want to set the is_active flag to true for users who registered after a certain date:
```SQL
UPDATE public.auth_user
SET is_active = true
WHERE registration_date > '2023-11-01';
```
This query will activate users who registered after January 1, 2023.


## Example 4: Bulk Update
To update a group of users based on a list of IDs, you can use the IN clause. For example, if you have a list of user IDs that you want to deactivate:
```SQL
UPDATE public.auth_user
SET is_active = false
WHERE user_id IN (1, 3, 5, 7);
```
This query will deactivate users with the specified IDs.

These are just a few examples of how the UPDATE query can be used to manage and modify data in your PostgreSQL database.
