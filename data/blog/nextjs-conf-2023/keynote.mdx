## Introduction
Guillermo Rauch started building Next.js seven years ago with the aim to have blazing fast framework without worring about the tools much. Now we have grew to a community of 850,000 active developers worldwide using Next.js. 

## Vote
To make this Keynote personalized, a vote was conducted at the below url:
```
next.js.org/vote
```
The top choices were in the following order;
1. nextjs 14
2. performance
3. Ecosystem
4. App Router

## App Router
The app router is designed to be Flexible, powerful and faster.
### Flexible
* Nested Layouts
* Colocated files
* Metadata API
* Simple Data Fetching
* Extend Web APIs 
### Powerful
* Async Components
* Server Actions
* On-Demand Revalidation
* Static and Dynamic
* Integrated Caching
* Cache Tags
### Faster
* Server Components
* Integrated Caching
* Optimized Compiler
* Streaming
* Faster Cold Boots
* Less Client JS
The react app router adoption to this date is upto 8263 websites. This really means that it has been battle tested.

## Next.js 14
1. No new APIs, hurray.
2. New API Docs.
3. Updated Designs.
4. Improved Search.
5. nextjs.org/learn: A complete guide to build with the App Router and everything you need to ship a production grade next.js sapplication.

## React.js and App Router
The next.js framework is built on top of react.js but it used hooks like `suspense` to fill components and it needed a new router, a new data fetching system and a streaming architecture. This vision actually visualized the new app routher.

## Server Actions
With Next.js 14, server actions are stable. 

## Performance
* 22% Faster Initial Compile
* 29% Faster Code Updates: It means when a developer saves and it appears in the browser.
These improvements are as a result of implementing Next.js in RUST and will be in RUST for now. The goals are;
1. Fast dev server
2. Fast code updates
3. Fast builds

Performance improvements that turbo-pack is going to unlock. 
* RUST powered Compiler
* 53% Faster Initial Compile
* 5000 Tests passing
* 94% Faster code updates

The turbo-pack is under development. To keep track of it, visit areweturboyet.com

## Simplify Next.js
The speed of the website can be measured in following metrics.
1. Fast Initial Visual
2. Fast Dynamic Visual
3. Great DX

## Partial Pre-Rendering.
The static content is pre-rendered at compile time and also pre-render the fallbacks of the dynamic content. Next.js can give static content immediate and then start to stream the dynamic content to fill in.
