The react app router adoption to this date is upto 8263 websites. This really means that it has been battle tested.

## Next.js 14

2. New API Docs.

5. nextjs.org/learn: A complete guide to build with the App Router and everything you need to ship a production grade next.js sapplication.

## React.js and App Router
The next.js framework is built on top of react.js but it used hooks like `suspense` to fill components and it needed a new router, a new data fetching system and a streaming architecture. This vision actually visualized the new app routher.

## Server Actions
With Next.js 14, server actions are stable.
