## Introduction
Next.js has become a popular framework for building React applications, offering server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features. If you're preparing for a Next.js interview, it's essential to have a strong understanding of its concepts and best practices. In this post, we'll cover a variety of Next.js interview questions and provide detailed answers with code examples to help you succeed in your interview preparation.

## Basics of Next.js
### What is Next.js, and how does it differ from React?
Answer: Next.js is a framework built on top of React that simplifies server-side rendering and routing. It provides features like automatic code splitting, static site generation, and easy deployment. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Next.js focuses on the full stack, including server-side rendering and routing.

### How do you create a new Next.js application?
To create a new Next.js application, you can use the following commands:
```
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```
This sets up a new Next.js project and starts the development server.

## Routing in Next.js
### How does routing work in Next.js, and how can you create dynamic routes?
Next.js provides file-based routing, where files in the pages directory correspond to routes. To create dynamic routes, you can use bracket notation in your file names. For example, a file named `[id].js` will match URLs like `/courses/1`.
```typescript
// pages/courses/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Course() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <div>Course ID: {id}</div>;
}

export default Course;

```

### How do you navigate to a different page in Next.js?
You can use the Link component from the next/link module to navigate between pages. Here's an example:
```typescript
import Link from 'next/Link'

<Link href="/about">
    <a>About Page</a>
</Link>
```

## API Routes
### What are API routes in Next.js, and how do you create them?
API routes in Next.js are serverless functions that allow you to create custom server APIs. You can create an API route by adding a file in the pages/api directory. For example, creating a pages/api/hello.js file would create an API endpoint accessible at /api/hello.
```typescript
// pages/api/hello.js

export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, Desi Guru!' });
}
```

### How do you make an API request from a Next.js page component?
You can use the fetch API to make API requests from a Next.js page component. Here's an example:
```typescript
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```
