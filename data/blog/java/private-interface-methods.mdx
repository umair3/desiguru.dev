# Private Interface Methods in Java

_Title_: Private Interface Methods in Java

_Author_: Umair Anwar

_Subject_: Java

_Language_: English

## Introduction
A private method in an interface is only accessible inside the interface only. This in turn means the following;
1. No class implementing the interface can access the private method.
2. No interface exteding the interface can access the private method.

The support for private methods was added in JDK 9.
